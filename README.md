# python-sketch-api
Python API to access and modify files from the "Sketch" software (https://www.sketchapp.com/), based on a Python object structure with typing hints.
Allows reading binary "plists", and consequently allows you to query information about text layers!

Includes all relevant data, even metadata and saving information.


**CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS READING!**

**Note that this is a work in progress. Enhanced top-level features will soon arrive, and so will writing. Reading the data was the difficult part!**


# Examples
    file = SketchFile.from_file('MyFile.sketch')


    file.sketch_pages
